## Controller or Controller
The control layer is responsible for intermediating the requests sent by the client with the answers provided by the Model, processing the data that the user informed and passing it on to other layers.

In a very simplistic analogy, the controller would operate as the ```conductor of an orchestra``` that allows communication between the data owner and the person with several questions in MVC.
